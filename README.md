# PS3Lib-Remastered

My slight upgrade to the PS3Lib. Updated with support for all major APIs, cleaner code, and something easier to work with.

## Credits

  Developed by Sony specifically for DEX (debug) consoles. TMAPI is an official Sony tool providing advanced features for debugging and managing PS3 consoles.

### Additional Notes

While these are the primary developers associated with each API, itâ€™s important to acknowledge that other contributors may have been involved in the development or maintenance of these tools over time. The PS3 homebrew and modding community has seen collaborative efforts from various developers.

These APIs serve different purposes and have varying levels of compatibility:

- **CCAPI**: Works on both CEX (retail) and DEX (debug) consoles.
- **PS3 Manager API**: Compatible with both CEX and DEX consoles and includes features from both TMAPI and CCAPI.
- **TMAPI**: Specifically for DEX consoles and is an official Sony development tool.

These APIs have played significant roles in PS3 homebrew development, game modding, and console management for developers and enthusiasts.
